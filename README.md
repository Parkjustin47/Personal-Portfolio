This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

If you are having trouble running the project, the .next and node_modules directories may need to be rebuilt.
These directories are commonly excluded through the .gitignore file since they can be regenerated.

To verify:
```bash
Check the .gitignore file to ensure the following entries exist:

.next/
node_modules/

Regenerate using:
npm run build
# or
next build

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page will automatically update as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
